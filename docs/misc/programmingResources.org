* Programming Resources
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: programming-resources
:END:
This is a continuation of the README file from the old "pylearn" git
repository. While the majority of these resources are Python-specific,
some additional general programming resources have been added, as they
provide more comprehensive instruction regarding general programming
methodologies that will be more useful than any language-specific
instruction alone.
