[DRAFT]

After resetting your NetID Password:

1.  Connect to VPN (Skip this step if on campus)
2.  Lock your screen
3.  Unlock your screen and enter your new NetID Password
4.  Open KWalletManager and select "Change Password" to change your
    kwallet password
5.  Open "Seahorse" and change any password keyrings listed to your new
    NetID password (change all to be safe)
6.  Update your local Nextcloud Desktop client password (this will
    require you to log into the desktop application again)
7.  Updated any SQL client passwords (DBeaver)
8.  Change your SAS password: [SAS Database
    Credentials](../sas/sasDatabaseCredentials.md)

There will be some other programs that will require a password change
(like your mail client, instant messaging client, etc), but these should
all prompt you for a password when needed.
