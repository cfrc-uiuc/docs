<td><p>When it comes to capitalization of academic degrees, The Chicago
Manual of Style and the Associated Press Style Book make different
recommendations. (Read more <a
href="https://data.grammarbook.com/blog/capitalization/capitalization-of-academic-degrees/">here</a>.)
However, it appears that the University of Illinois (in its style guide
<a
href="https://www.uillinois.edu/OUR/brand/style/writing_style_guide">here</a>)
basically follows the AP rules, and CFRC will strive to do the same. Our
suggestions are as follows:</p>
<p>Use initial capitals for fully-spelled-out names of academic degrees
(Bachelor of Arts, Master of Science). (<a
href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Academic_degrees">Here is
a list of common fully-spelled-out degrees.</a>) Use lowercase if the
degree is being referred to in a less formal sense (bachelor’s degree,
master's, doctoral degree). (Apostrophes are not to be used for
associate or doctoral degrees.)</p>
<p>Things get more complicated when areas or courses of study are
involved... When a school offers a specific course of study, such
courses should be capitalized. However, there are areas of study which
are not necessarily the names of specific courses or majors at specific
schools, in which case such areas should NOT be capitalized. Especially
when writing on behalf of someone else, it can be difficult to determine
the difference between these two, so we recommend erring on the side of
capitalization.</p></td>

adjective modifies a noun. Many (though not all) adverbs end in
"ly."</p>
<p>In general, adverbs are NOT PREFERRED. It is better to choose a
strong verb.</p>
<p>In some cases, an adverb may be used when none is needed.</p></td>

<p>Suggestions for Improvement: Instead of "he ran quickly," write "he
sprinted" Instead of "increased dramatically," write "spiked"</p>
<p>When No Adverb Is Needed: Instead of "very strongly increased,"
perhaps "increased" would suffice Instead of "absolutely, decidedly
agreed," perhaps "agreed" would suffice</p></td>

colon? Our current policy recommend one space after a colon. 2. Should
the word after a colon be capitalized? Here, follow APA style. If the
words after are a complete sentence, then the first letter of the first

Microsoft Word, you get a dash by pressing the dash key. Double dashes
with spaces on either side are converted to en-dashes. Double dashes
with no spaces on either side are converted to em-dashes.</p>
<p>In most circumstances, when deciding between an en-dash and an
em-dash, you mean to use an em-dash, the longer one. The em-dash is a
very versatile punctuation mark and takes the place of punctuation marks
like parentheses and commas.</p>
<p>The en-dash is only used when expressing a range. For example,
“please see pages 31–32."</p>
<p>A dash (hyphen) is used with compound words. For example,
“free-range” or “pro-choice.”</p></td>

money). For reference, see this New York Times page: <a

<p>In general, quoting from the linked page, "When [majority] refers to
a group of persons or things that are in the majority, it may take
either a singular or plural verb, depending on whether the group is
considered as a whole or as a set of people considered individually."
Please see examples for further clarification.</p></td>
<td><p>A real example from the 2014 <em>B.H.</em> report: "As shown, a
majority [of families] do not receive any post-investigation services."
Here, we are discussing each family as an individual unit. They are not
acting in concert with each other; they are a majority merely as part of
the data. As such, it is right to use a plural verb.</p>
<p>Another example: "The majority elects to adjourn." Here, we refer to
majority as a single entity. This is often done in politics or other
situations in which voting is how business is accomplished. In these
circumstances, a singular verb is appropriate.</p></td>

<td><p>A topic sentence is the first sentence of a paragraph. In
general, it functions as a one-sentence outline of everything that is
contained in the paragraph. The rest of the paragraph functions to
support the claim made in the topic sentence.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb: A paper is written well if you can read just
the topic sentences and understand the paper.</p></td>
<td><p>There are many better examples than this one, but here is a
paragraph from a paper I wrote a few years ago: The Technology
Acceptance Model (TAM; Davis, 1989; Davis et al., 1989) predicts
intention to use a new technology. The model was initially used to
predict acceptance of workplace technologies in an age of increasing
personal computer use. Using frameworks found in an initial study of
user’s interest in technology (Robey, 1979; Schultz &amp; Slevin, 1975),
Davis found two factors, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness
predicted intention to use an information technology.</p></td>

grammatical subject expresses the theme or patient of the main verb –
that is, the person or thing that undergoes the action or has its state
changed." Active voice: "[I]n a clause [with active voice], [the]
subject expresses the agent of the main verb."</p>

restrictive age range. For example, if talking about young people ages
13-18 (or older), adolescent is preferred. If talking about young people

for contrasting two events. See the examples to the right.</p>
<p>Be cautious, however, when using it instead of the word "though."
"Though" should be read as "in contrast to" and thus does not mean two
events happening at the same time.</p></td>
<td><p>Proper Use of While: "The children played in the meadow while the
parents prepared food for the picnic." The two events are happening at
the same time, so "while" is appropriate. The sentence is not trying to
contrast the two activities.</p>
<p>Proper Use of Though: "The girls read quietly, though the boys played
catch with a baseball, ." Here, even though the two events are going on
at the same time, a contrast is intended. We picture the girls quietly
reading even though the boys are engaged in active play. The contrast
helps us understand the gender dynamics in the situation.</p></td>
