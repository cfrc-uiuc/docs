# CFRC Programming Libraries

Some libraries have been created and maintained by CFRC to facilitate access to CFRC hosted databases as well as abstract common functions used as part of the CFRC's work. These libraries are only available to internal users.

## Python
A library for those using Python. This library includes database connection functions, some data structure aggregation utilities, and more. For usage, see: [cfrctoolbox](https://github.com/cfrc-uiuc/cfrctoolbox).

## Clojure
This library serves the same function as the above Python library, except for a Clojure development environment. For usage, see: [clj-toolbox](https://github.com/cfrc-uiuc/clj-toolbox).
