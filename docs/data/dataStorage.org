All data should be stored on a centralized server, rather than on
individual desktops. A common practice among statisticians is save data
as a CSV file, SAS or SPSS dataset, or some other file type, and store
that data on a local desktop or share that data set with others. While
this method of data access may seem simple and convenient, there are a
number of drawbacks. Two of the primary disadvantages are that such
local file storage can compromise both data security and data integrity.
