# ODBC Connection Setup

ODBC connections are a method of accessing many database types through "ODBC" drivers. Many statistics softwares, such as Stata and SPSS, require ODBC connections on Windows in order to access database servers.

## ODBC setup

ODBC connections are setup through the Windows "ODBC Data Source Administrator".

1. Start by clicking on your Start menu (in Windows) and type/search "ODBC". You should see the "ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)" application appear in the menu (click on this).
