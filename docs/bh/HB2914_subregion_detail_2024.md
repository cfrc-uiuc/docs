### Racial/Ethnic Disproportionality Data for the Past Five Years (Subregion and Cook Region) ###
<p>
This web page provides additional data on racial disproportionality in the Illinois Child Welfare System. Five years of data is included for the following subregions: Aurora (2A), Rockford (1A), Champaign (3B), Peoria (1B), Springfield (3A), East St. Louis (4A), and Marion (5A). The Cook region included Cook North, Cook Central, and Cook South subregions. Due to small group sizes for the Native American and Pacific Islander racial/ethnic groups, only five of the seven racial groups included in the FY2024 Report are reported (Black, White, Latinx, Asian, and Multiracial).
</p>
<p>To access the data, please download the subregion file(s) (or Cook region file). Each file includes an index and a worksheet for each of the 44 indicator outcomes. After opening the file, choose the Index worksheet and click the indicator name you wish to view. That will take you to the indicator outcome for the five racial/ethnic groups over the past 5 years. </p>

##### Notes ######
1. The numbers in this file are rounded to 2 decimal places for display purposes. 
2. If the number of children in a racial/ethnic group for an indicator was 20 or fewer or the base population for calculating an RDI was less than 0.1%, the RDI and the percentages used to compute the RDI are masked with an asterisk (*). This is because percentages based on small numbers are unreliable.
3. The data comes from 3 sources.
   - Illinois child population data (ages 0â€“19) was obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau.
   - All child welfare data are sourced from the DCFS Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), except for the court screening indicators (Indicators 19 through 27), which are sourced from the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS). The EDW data was extracted on October 7, 2024, and the SACWIS data was extracted on June 30, 2024. Please note that it is possible that there are some cases with missing court-screening information in the 2024 cohort due to the data lag.
4. The Illinois child population data with ages 0-19, not ages 0-17, was used for Indicators 1 through 30 because we needed the data with seven racial/ethnic groups for the subregion level analysis.
