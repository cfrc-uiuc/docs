Introduction

</h1>

The Children and Family Research Center (CFRC) monitors the performance
of the Illinois child welfare system by evaluating how well it achieves
its stated goals of child safety, permanency, and well-being. Using the
administrative data processed by the Illinois Department of Children and
Family Services (DCFS), we produce various safety and permanency outcome
indicators of children served by DCFS. The *Monitoring Report of the
B.H. Consent Degree* (**the *B.H.* report**) is the culmination of the
CFRC’s efforts to provide clear and comprehensive data to a variety of
stakeholders who are concerned with the outcomes of maltreated children
in Illinois.

The administrative data are extracted from two DCFS information systems:
SACWIS (the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System) and
LGC (Legacy Golden Copy). The SACWIS data mainly track allegations and
findings of abuse and neglect reported to and investigated by DCFS. The
LGC data include detailed client, service provision, and payment records
for children and families who receive DCFS child welfare services. Four
times a year (March, June, September, and December) we transfer data
from the DCFS data warehouse to our database.

Each of the tables was developed based on the data file we used to
receive from the Chapin Hall Center for Children. Prior to FY2018, CFRC
utilized DCFS administrative data processed by Chapin Hall (Integrated
Database, known as IDB) to compute the outcome indicators included in
the *B.H.* report. In FY2016 CFRC was given direct access to the DCFS
data warehouse, which contains information from the numerous data
systems currently in use at the Department. In FY2018 CFRC switched the
data source from the Chapin Hall Integrated Database to data extracted
from the DCFS data warehouse to compute the outcome indicators in the
*B.H.* report. Although the data contained in the two data sources are
similar, they are not equivalent. For more details about the data
changes, please read the introduction chapter and Appendix E in [the
FY2018 *B.H.*
report](https://www.cfrc.illinois.edu/pubs/rp_20181029_ConditionsOfChildrenInOrAtRiskOfFosterCareInIllinoisFY2018MonitoringReportOfTheBHConsentDecree.pdf).

After the database tables in the BH schema are updated,
indicator-specific database tables are created and saved in the BH_IND
schema. BH and CFSR (Child and Family Services Reviews) indicator
outcomes are produced for the *B.H.* report and Data Center. To see the
list of the BH outcome indicators and the performance trend, visit
[CFRC's Data Center
webpage](https://www.cfrc.illinois.edu/outcome-indicator-tables.php).
Results in each BH outcome indicator are sorted by child's age, race,
and gender. You can learn the trend not only by all children in Illinois
but also in a specific region, subregion, or county. The [CFSR Indicator
Table](https://www.cfrc.illinois.edu/cfsr-tables.php) page in Data
Center is a good start to learn about the CFSR measures that are used
for the *B.H.* report. See the file */CFRC/SAS/BH/readme* for more
details about the sequence of programs that is run to produce the
database tables for the BH and BH_IND schemas.

<h1>

Tables in BH Schema

</h1>

We extract the administrative data from DCFS and clean them. After that,
we create a series of BH database tables in the BH schema.

<h1>

Tables in BH_IND Schema

The table below presents the indicator name, programming file, and the
data table used for creating the indicator. Each indicator-specific
table is saved in the BH_IND schema.

Issues with Allegation 60 (or *Ashley M.* or *Julie Q.*)

</h1>

The Illinois Supreme Court issued a decision in the case of *Julie Q. v.
Illinois Department of Children and Family Services*, 2013 IL 113783
(March 21, 2013), in which the court held that Allegation 60 was void
because DCFS did not have the authority to investigate and indicate an
allegation based on an “environment injurious” because the “injurious
environment” language was removed from the definition of neglected child
in the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act in 1980. Individuals
investigated and indicated for Allegation 60 prior to July 13, 2012 will
be removed as indicated perpetrators of child abuse and neglect for
Allegation 60 from the department’s State Central Register in light of
the court’s decision. All other indicated findings remain unchanged.

Effective July 13, 2012, the Illinois General Assembly reinstated the
term “environment injurious” in the definition of neglected child in the
Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act. All indicated findings for
Allegation 60 investigated and indicated on and after July 13, 2012 will
remain on the State Central Register unless they are removed in
accordance with the department’s normal retention period, pursuant to a
final administrative decision of the director or other court order. [^1]

*Ashley M.* and *Julie Q.* are the two class action suits leading to
court orders to unfound indicated reports. During the periods covered by
these reports all allegation 60 - 'Risk of Harm'- indicated findings are
reversed (unfounded). Findings for allegation 60 for reports outside
those periods remain unaffected.

The result is inconsistency in counts of indicated reports across time
and inconsistency counting indicated reports within a period at two
different times when these court orders are implemented. Trends can be
established for total number of reports investigated and numbers of
non-risk of harm allegations indicated, just not for indicated reports,
for the affected allegation, or indicated victims if the only indicated
allegation is that affected allegation. [^2]

| Class Action Lawsuit | Period Affected                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Julie Q.             | October 1, 2001 - July 12, 2012   |
| Ashley M.            | July 13, 2012 - December 31, 2013 |
| Ashley M.            | May 31, 2014 - June 11, 2014      |

Glossary

## Adoption dissolution

- Means a circumstance where the child is removed from an adoptive
  placement after the adoption is finalized. \[750 ILCS 50/1(AA)\] [^3]

## Adoption subsidy (or Adoption assistance)

- Our database does not contain an specific indicator for the number of
  former DCFS wards who are, at any given time, living at home with
  adoptive parents, nor does it contain and indicator of how many of
  these adoptions are temporarily or permanently disturbed. A majority
  of adoption completed through DCFS are subsidized, typically until the
  children reaches 18. Therefore, the number of open adoption subsidy
  cases is used as an indicator of the number of children living with
  adoptive parent.
- If the type of service arrangement is coded as one of the following
  service payment codes, we define the case as an adoption subsidy (or
  adoption assistance).

are not listed on the current SACWIS table.

## Age

- Child age is used for the age category. For more details for each
  indicator, see the table below.
- If the child's age was unknown due to the missing birth date or
  yielded a negative value (\< 0), we coded the value as missing and
  excluded from the percent calculations in the age category.

## Age group

- [Child age](BH_Data#Age "wikilink") is organized by the following four
  intervals and derived from a child's date of birth.
  - Under 3 years old
  - 3 to 5
  - 6 to 11
  - 12 to 17

<!-- -->

- To show the change of the family allegation reports, the first
  caregiver listed on the family report is broken down into six
  categories. They are:
  - Under 20 years old
  - 20 to 29
  - 30 to 39
  - 40 to 49
  - 50 to 59
  - 60 and older

## Allegation of abuse/neglect

- The allegation system defines moderate to severe harm or the risk of
  moderate to severe harm of a child. Many of the allegations are
  categorized as either abuse or neglect. All abuse allegations of harm
  are coded with a one or two-digit number, 40 and under. All neglect
  allegations of harm are coded with a two-digit number greater than 50.

- One investigation can have more than one allegation. A victim can have
  more than one household id (scrnum), which indicates that the child
  has changed household over time.
- As of March 31, 2020, 55 allegation codes are active (see the table
  below). To see the compleat list of allegations in SACWIS, including
  the ones currently not in use, see SACWIS.code_desc (id_grp=ALLEGCOD).

## Disproportionality

- The underrepresentation or overrepresentation of a racial or ethnic
  group compared to its percentage in the total population.[^6]
- It refers to a group’s representation in a particular category that
  exceeds expectations for that group, or differs substantially from the
  representation of others in that category.
  \[<https://www.nasponline.org/resources-and-publications/resources-and-podcasts/diversity/disproportionality#>:\~:text=Disproportionality%20refers%20to%20a%20group's,of%20others%20in%20that%20category.\]

## Emergency foster home (EFH)

- For the initial placement indicators, a child who enters an emergency
  foster home and stays in EFH for 8 days or longer is counted in the
  *B.H.* report.
- For the end-of-year placement indicators, a child placed in EFH at the
  end of the fiscal year is counted in the *B.H.* report.
- Emergency Foster Home used to be under "traditional foster homes." In
  January, 2018, we decided to include EFH under "emergency shelter"
  category.
- If the type of service arrangement is coded as one of the following
  service payment codes, the placement is defined as an emergency foster
  home.

- Alternatively, if living arrangement type is coded as an emergency
  foster care (EFC) and there was no type of service code, the the
  placement is defined as EFC.

## Emergency shelter

- Emergency shelters provide temporary living arrangements for children
  if no other possible foster home placements can be arranged. IL DCFS
  policy states that placements in emergency shelters should not exceed
  30 calendar days.[^7]
- For the initial placement indicators, a child who enters an emergency
  shelter and stays in the emergency shelter for 8 days or longer is
  counted in the *B.H.* report.
- For the end-of-year placement indicators, a child placed in an
  emergency shelter at the end of the fiscal year is counted in the
  *B.H.* report.
- If the type of service arrangement is coded as one of the following
  service payment codes, the placement is defined as an emergency
  shelter.

| cd_type_serv | Description                              |

| 223          | Youth Emergency Shelters                 |
| 7221         | Medicaid-Emergency Shelters-Institutions |

- Alternatively, if living arrangement type is coded as (a) either youth
  emergency shelter (YES) or shelter (SHL) and (b) there was no type of
  service code, the the placement is defined as an emergency shelter.

## Ethnicity

- The ethnicity variable includes 13 codes designating Hispanic origin
  (see SACWIS.code_desc table for more details; id_grp=ETHNCITY). The
  codes are:
  - 'NH' for Not Hispanic
  - 'HS' for Hispanic South American
  - 'HC' for Hispanic Cuban
  - 'HM' for Hispanic Mexican
  - 'HP' for Hispanic Puerto Rican
  - 'HD' for Hispanic Spanish Descent
  - 'NR' for Not reported (note that currently it is not in use)
  - 'HO' for Hispanic Other
  - 'HN' for Hispanic Dominican
  - 'HA' for Hispanic Central American
  - 'DI' for Declined to Identify
  - 'CV' for Could not be verified
  - 'UK' for Unknown

<!-- -->

- If the ethnicity code is either 'HA', 'HC', 'HM', 'HN', 'HP', 'HS',
  'HD', or 'HO,' the person is coded as Hispanic. After that, we combine
  this variable with the [race](BH_Data#Race "wikilink") variable to
  create the [race/ethnicity](BH_Data#Race/Ethnicity "wikilink")
  variable for *B.H.* report.

## End of year placement

- The substitute care that a child was staying on the last day of the
  state fiscal year (June 30).

## Event

- The "event" field includes a placement where a child was placed to.
  See the DATAREF.event_xref table for more updates.

## Exit from substitute care

- Some children exit from substitute care to achive legal permanence
  (i.e., adoption, reunification, guardianship, and living with
  relatives). Others exit substitute care without ever achieving legal
  permanence (e.g., aged out, entering a hospital or institution,
  independent living, incarcerated, runaway, death, other setting).
- Read [Otherwise exit](BH_Data#Otherwise_exit "wikilink") for more
  details about other exit type without ever achieving legal permanence.
- The coding scheme for "non-permanency exit from substitute care" was
  changed to the following in November, 2017.

`If censor=4 and endevent in ('FHA','FHI','FHP','FHS','FHB','HMR','ZZZ','OTH','UNK','UAP','UAH','ASD') and agelastpl >= 17 then exittype='Aged Out ';`
`else if censor=4 and endevent in ('HHF','IPA','NCF','GRH','IMH','IRS','ICF') then exittype='Hosp/Inst';`
`else if censor=4 and endevent in ('ILO','CIL','TLP','YIC','JTP','YIE','CUS',) then exittype='Ind Liv';`
`else if censor=4 and endevent in ('DET','IDC') then exittype='Incarcerated';`
`else if censor=4 and endevent in ('RNY','ABD','WUK','WCC') then exittype='Runaway';`
`else if censor=4 and endevent in ('DEC') then exittype='Death';`
`else if censor=4 and endevent in ('FHA','FHI','FHP','FHS','HMR','OTH','ZZZ','UNK','FHB','UAP','DRA') then exittype='Other';`

- Note that we categorized YIE, CUS into independent living.
- Also note that we added FHB to aged out.

## Fictive kin

- A fictive kin is a person who has close personal or emotional ties
  with the child or the child’s family prior to the child’s placement
  with the person. The Placing Worker shall ask the parents and the
  child to identify fictive kin who may be able to serve as a caregiver
  for a child entering substitute care, and shall again inquire, as
  appropriate, any time a child in care requires a new foster home
  placement. <ref name="procedures301">Illinois Department of Children
  and Family Services. (2016). Procedures 301, Placement and Visitation
  Services. Springfield: Author. Retrieved from
  <https://www2.illinois.gov/dcfs/aboutus/notices/Documents/Procedures_301.pdf>

</ref>

## Fiscal year (FY)

- A fiscal year is a 12-month period used by governments. A fiscal year
  starting on July 1, 2018, and ending on June 30, 2019, refers to the
  fiscal year 2019, or FY2019.

## Gender

- Child gender is categorized as Female or Male. Children for whom
  gender is not coded are reported as having a Missing gender and
  excluded from the percent calculations in the gender category.

## Group home (GH)

- It refers to a non-family, community-based residence that houses more
  children than are permitted to reside in a foster family home, but
  fewer than reside in a residential treatment center (in Illinois, the
  number of children in a group home is limited to 10 or fewer). Group
  homes are operated by professional staff who work in rotating
  shifts.[^8]
- For the initial placement indicators, a child who enters GH and stays
  in GH for 8 days or longer is counted in the *B.H.* report.
- For the end-of-year placement indicators, a child placed in GH at the
  end of the fiscal year is counted in the *B.H.* report.
- If the type of service arrangement is coded as one of the following
  service payment codes, the placement is defined as a group home.

| cd_type_serv | Description                     |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| 203          | Private Group Homes             |
| 233          | Performance Group Home          |
| 7202         | Med GH Fee For Service          |
| 7203         | Medicaid/Private Group Homes    |
| 7233         | Performance Medicaid Group Home |

- Alternatively, if living arrangement type is coded as Group Home (GRH)
  and there was no type of service code, the the placement is defined as
  group home.

## Guardianship

- It refers to subsidized guardianship, which is a program that provides
  financial assistance for caregivers who take legal guardianship of
  children who can no longer live with their parents. ([Children's
  Bureau](https://www.childwelfare.gov/))

## Home of parent (HMP)

- Placement of children with the non-offending parent or in the home of
  the parent(s) prior to reunification or termination of child welfare
  services. When home of parent is used as a placement, DCFS retains
  legal responsibility for the child.[^9]
- Since FY2018, Home of Parent has been included as a placement type in
  the calculation of several indicators related to placement in
  substitute care. Children in HMP with an “AA” (adoption assistance)
  open code are excluded from the initial placements. Children whose
  legal custody is DCFS and the placement type is HMP are included in
  the out-of-home placements when we calculate the end-of-year
  placements, regardless of their open code status.
- Prior to FY2018, HMP was not considered as an out-of-home placement
  type.

## Independent living

- Independent living placements are distinct from substitute care
  placements. According to DCFS policy guides, independent living
  services are defined as “casework and other supportive services that
  are provided to assist eligible youth living in an apartment in the
  community to prepare for transition to adulthood and self-sufficiency,
  and establish (or reestablish) legal relationships and/or permanent
  connections with committed adults.” "This program level is developed
  for youth over 19 years of age who have demonstrated the capacity for
  economic self-sufficiency, graduated from an accredited high school or
  obtained a GED, and are employed or employable." [^10]
- If the type of service arrangement is coded as one of the following
  service payment codes, the placement is defined as an independent
  living placement.

- Alternatively, if living arrangement type is coded as either 'ILO,'
  'CIL,' or 'TLP' and there was no type of service code, the the
  placement is defined as an independent living.

## Indicated

- An investigation of suspected child abuse/neglect has revealed
  credible evidence that the abuse/neglect occurred.
  <ref name="IDCFS2017">

Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. (2017). Child
abuse/neglect statistics. Springfield: Author. Retrieved from
<https://www2.illinois.gov/dcfs/aboutus/newsandreports/Documents/CANStat.pdf#search=indicated%20report>

- An investigation report is indicated if the finding is coded 3 in the
  CD_INVST_FIND field in SACWIS.investigation.
- An allegation is indicated if the finding is coded 3 in the CD_FIND
  field in SACWIS.invst.allegation.

## Initial placement

- The substitute care that a child first entered within a given fiscal
  year.

## Institution

- All non-family settings, except for group home, are combined into a
  broad category called institutions in *B.H.* report. This category
  includes a variety of congregate care placements such as residential
  treatment centers, detention centers, hospitals, and other health
  facilities. [^11]
- For the initial placement indicators, a child who enters an
  institution and stays in the institution for 8 days or longer is
  counted in the *B.H.* report.
- For the end-of-year placement indicators, a child placed in an
  institution at the end of the fiscal year is counted in the *B.H.*
  report.
- If the type of service arrangement is coded as one of the following
  service payment codes, the placement is defined as an institution.

- Alternatively, if living arrangement type is coded as one of the codes
  below and there was no type of service code, the placement is defined
  as an institution.

## Intact family case

- An intact family service case can be opened in several
  circumstances: 1) following an indicated investigation when no
  children are removed and the parents voluntarily accept services; 2)
  following an indicated investigation with a court order if the family
  refuses to accept the services; 3) during a pending investigation if
  the family has an identified service need; 4) when a child returns
  home after being in placement less than 30 days (protective custody
  lapse); and 5) following an unfounded investigation per DCFS request
  or court order. The goal of intact family services is to mitigate the
  identified risk factors in 6 to 12 months. <ref name="rb_cerap">
  Fuller, T. L., Chiu, Y., Wakita, S., & Nieto, M. (2018). Understanding
  Safety Assessment in Illinois: CERAP Completion in Intact Family
  Services. Urbana, IL: Children and Family Research Center, University
  of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

- Any service provided to the family while the child remains in the
  home. Children remains at home while the family receives supportive
  services rather than being placed into substitute care. Services may
  be provided directly in the child's home or a professional setting.
- In some instances, the Department will indicate a family for child
  maltreatment, but decide that it is in the best interest of the child
  and family to receive services at home rather than place the child
  into substitute care.[^12]
- In-home services offered to DCFS-referred families focused on
  providing education and case management in order to prevent children
  from entering foster care. Intact services are most often voluntary
  but may also be court-ordered, and can provide in-home counseling,
  crisis response, and linkage to appropriate treatment programs (e.g.,
  substance abuse) or services (e.g., medical clinics, Section 8 housing
  assistance, childcare) at no cost to the family. [^13]
- The intact family case in our CERAP study is defined as one in which
  all children remained in the home on the case opening date. In other
  words, no children were removed from the home and placed into
  substitute care. Intact family cases that were open for 7 days or less
  were excluded from the intact family case data. Cases where children
  in the family entered substitute care within 30 days of the case open
  date were also excluded from the intact family case data. [^14]

## Kinship foster home

- It involves placement of children with relatives in the relatives'
  homes. Relatives are the preferred placement for Children who must be
  removed from their parents, as this kind of placement maintains the
  children's connections with their families. In Illinois, kinship care
  providers may be licensed or unlicensed.[^15]
- For the initial placement indicators, a child who enters a kinship
  foster home and stays in the kinship foster home for 8 days or longer
  is counted in the *B.H.* report.
- For the end-of-year placement indicators, a child placed in a kinship
  foster home at the end of the fiscal year is counted in the *B.H.*
  report.
- If the type of service arrangement is coded as one of the following
  service payment codes, the placement is defined as a kinship foster
  home.

- Alternatively, if living arrangement type is coded as a) either
  'DRA'(Delegated Relative Author), 'HMR'(Home of Relative), 'HRA'(Home
  of Relative Applicant), 'HRL'(Home of Relative Licensed), or
  'HFK'(Home of Fictive Kin) and b) there was no type of service code,
  then the placement is defined as kinship foster home.

## Legal permanence

- The term legal permanence implies a desired permanence, and that is
  what we focused on the *B.H.* report. For instance, “aged out” is not
  a desired permanency outcome. We also began using children’s legal
  status by using the master_spell_lgl. Reunification is achieved when
  the child is returned home and (a) the legal custody is transferred
  back to parent(s) or (b) the placement case is closed. If the child is
  returned home, his/her legal custody is not transferred and the
  placement case is open (i.e., not legally permanent), it is considered
  as “still in care.”

## Living arrangement code (livarcd)

- Refers to a child's living arrangement type code.

## Median length of stay in substitute care

- The median number of months children stay in substitute care. Length
  of stay is presented in months.
- The median represents the amount of time that it took half of children
  who entered substitute care in a fiscal year to exit care.
- In the BH measure the length of stay in substitute care is calculated
  using the first [spell](BH_Data#Spell "wikilink") after a child was
  placed in a substitute care. See [Indicator: median length of stay in
  substitute care](BH_Data#ind2g_lengthofstay "wikilink").
- If the child has more than one spell during the fiscal year, the first
  [spell](BH_Data#Spell "wikilink") is selected.

## Non-permanency exit

- includes incarceration, aging out, and running away.

## Northern region

- A value of Northern region was defined as regions *1A* (Rockford) and
  *2A* (Aurora).

## Otherwise exit

- A child does not achieve legal permanence and exits the substitute
  care due to the following reasons:
  - child deceased
  - court order release
  - court jurisdiction not taken
  - reached majority
  - service completed
  - other reason

## Permanence (or permanency)

- Every child is entitled to a guardian of the person, either a natural
  guardian by birth or adoption or a legal guardian appointed by the
  court.[^16]
- In the BH measure, children achieve permanency through reunification,
  adoption or guardianship.
- In the CFSR measure, permanency includes discharges from foster care
  to reunification with the child’s parents or primary caregivers,
  living with a relative, guardianship, or adoption. Youth entering at
  age 17 who turn 18 while in care or discharge at age 18 are not
  counted as achieving permanency.

## Permanency exit

- It includes exiting from substitute care due to
  [reunification](BH_Data#Reunification "wikilink"), adoption,
  guardianship, living with relatives, and [otherwise
  exited](BH_Data#Otherwise_exit "wikilink"). A relative assumes legal
  guardianship of a child without receiving a subsidy or becoming
  licensed foster parents.

## Permanency stability

The stability of the permanent placements should be monitored to ensure
that the children who exit substitute care do not re-enter care. The
stability of each type of permanence is monitored by examining the
percentage of reunifications, adoptions, and guardianships that remain
intact (i.e., the children do not re-enter substitute care) within one
year (reunification only), two years, five years, and ten years
post-discharge.

## Perpetrator

- Means a person who, as a result of investigation, has been determined
  by the Department to have caused child abuse or neglect. \[325 ILCS
  5/3\] [^17]

## Placement

- Placement is defined on the bases of two fields from the IDCFS's
  Legacy Golden Copy database: type of service categorization and child
  living arrangement type. In constructing each placement type, type of
  service categorization was given priority over child living
  arrangement type.

## Placement stability

- Of all children who entered substitute care during the fiscal year,
  the rate of placement moves per 1,000 days of care.

## Placement type

There are seven placement types in the *B.H.* report:

- [Home of parent(s)](BH_Data#Home_of_parent "wikilink")
- [Kinship foster home](BH_Data#Kinship_foster_home "wikilink")
- [Traditional foster home](BH_Data#Traditional_foster_home "wikilink")
- [Specialized or treatment foster
  home](BH_Data#Specialized_or_treatment_foster_home "wikilink")
- [Emergency shelter](BH_Data#Emergency_shelter "wikilink") or
  [emergency foster
  home](BH_Data#Emergency_foster_home_(EFH) "wikilink")
- [Group home](BH_Data#Group_home "wikilink")
- [Institution](BH_Data#Institution "wikilink")

## Protective custody

- Once a determination has been made by child protective services that
  intervention is necessary to safeguard the welfare of a child, the
  next choice that child welfare workers must make is whether the child
  can be safely served in the home or should be taken into protective
  custody and placed in foster care.[^18]

## Race

- There are originally nine race categories. See the SACWIS.code_desc
  table for more details (id_grp=RACECODE).
  - 'NA' for Native American/Alaska Native
  - 'BL' for Black
  - 'AO' for Asian
  - 'PI' for Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander'
  - 'WH' for White; 'DI' for declined to identify
  - 'CV' for could not be verified
  - 'UN' for unknown
  - 'NR' for not reported (note that 'NR' is not currently in use)

<!-- -->

- We look at the primary race category only. Combining with the
  ethnicity information, we recode four race/ethnicity categories. They
  are: Non-Hispanic Black; Non-Hispanic White; Hispanic; and Other.
- "Other" race/ethnicity includes Native American/Alaska Native, Asian,
  and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders. If the value of
  race/ethnicity is 'CV', 'UN' , 'DI' or missing (null), it is recoded
  as *missing*.
- For more information about how to code Hispanic, see
  [Ethnicity](BH_Data#Ethnicity "wikilink").
- For more information about the operational definition of
  race/ethnicity, see
  [Race/Ethnicity](BH_Data#Race/Ethnicity "wikilink").

## Race/Ethnicity

- The race/ethnicity variable used in the B.H. report was created from
  two variables in the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information
  System (SACWIS) and the Child and Youth Centered Information System
  (CYCIS): primary race and ethnicity.
- The ethnicity variable includes several codes designating Hispanic
  origin, including Hispanic South American, Hispanic Cuban, Hispanic
  Mexican, Hispanic Puerto Rican, Hispanic Spanish Descent, Hispanic
  Dominican, Hispanic Central American, and Hispanic Other. If the
  individual’s ethnicity was coded as any of these, their race/ethnicity
  in this report was coded as “Hispanic” regardless of the primary race
  code. If the individual’s ethnicity was not of Hispanic origin, their
  race/ethnicity in this report was determined using the code in the
  primary race variable contained in SACWIS and CYCIS.
- Values on the primary race variable include: White, Black, Native
  American/Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific
  Islanders.
- Because the numbers in categories other than White and Black are
  small, they are combined into one category labeled as “other
  race/ethnicity.”
- Note that if the value of primary race was “could not be verified,”
  “unknown,” “declined to identify,” or missing (null), it was treated
  as missing and excluded when indicators are reported by
  race/ethnicity.
- For more information about the original race code, see
  [Race](BH_Data#Race "wikilink").

## Recurrence

- The most common definition of recurrence is a substantiated report
  following a prior substantiation that involves the same child or
  family. [^19]
- In B.H. report, recurrence is defined as an indicated allegation
  followed by another indicated allegation within a 12 month period at
  the child level. Technically, we choose the first indicated allegation
  for the fiscal year. Note that the first occurred indicated allegation
  during the fiscal year is selected if there are more than one
  indicated allegation for the child victim in order to avoid the
  duplication. The unit of analysis is a child with an indicated
  allegation in the report.

## Re-entry to substitute care

- This is one of the outcomes to measure the permanence stability.

- There are four regions: [Cook](BH_Data#Cook_region "wikilink");
  [Northern](BH_Data#Northern_region "wikilink");
  [Central](BH_Data#Central_region "wikilink"); and
  [Southern](BH_Data#Southern_region "wikilink"). The region refers to
  the DCFS administrative region.
- To understand the relationships among region code, subregion, and
  region, see the DATAREF.region_xref table.
- In *B.H.* reports, prior to FY2018, the region information was a
  combination of case open region and region at case closing. In other
  words, if the case is closed, use the region at the case closing.
- For the B.H. indicators related to substitute care, we generally use
  the DCFS administrative region at the case opening the outcome
  indicators are related to the initial placements and the source of the
  region comes from the LGC table.
- For the outcome indicators related to the end-of-year placements and
  the source of the region comes from the LGC table, we use the closest
  effective date to the end of the year within the FY.
- Table 1 shows decision rules for the region for each BH/CFSR
  indicator.

## Report

- If the Hotline worker concludes that the allegation is one the
  department is legally empowered to investigate and that there is
  sufficient information to warrant investigation, a report will be
  taken. This means that DCFS will initiate an investigation of the
  allegations. Every call to the Hotline does not necessarily result in
  a report.<ref name="DCFSmanual">Illinois Department of Children and
  Family Services. (2019). Manual for Mandated Reporters. Springfield:
  Author. Retrieved from
  <https://mr.dcfstraining.org/public/pdf/en/Mandated-Reporter-Manual.pdf>

</ref>

## Reunification

- Refers to the process of returning children in temporary out-of-home
  care to their families of origin. Reunification is both the primary
  goal for children in out-of-home care as well as the most common
  outcome. ([Children's Bureau](https://www.childwelfare.gov/))
  Reunification with parents is the preferred method for achieving
  permanence for children in substitute care.
- In the *B.H.* measure, a reunification is achieved when the child is
  returned home and (a) the legal custody is transferred back to
  parent(s) or (b) the placement case is closed. If the child is
  returned home, his/her legal custody is not transferred and the
  placement case is open (i.e., not legally permanent), it is considered
  as “still in care.”

## Runaway

- If the type of service arrangement is coded as a) either runaway
  (RNY), auducted (ABD), whereabouts unknown periodic contact with
  caseworker (WCC), or whereabout unknown (WUK) and b) there was no any
  service type coded, the placement is defined as a runaway.

## Safe (in Child Endangerment Risk Assessment)

- Means that, after considering all reasonably available
  information/evidence concerning the presence of each of the 16
  potential safety threats, and taking into account the vulnerability of
  the child, and considering the caregiver(s)’s displayed ability/action
  to mitigate any identified threats, it is determined that a child in a
  household or in custodial care is not likely to be moderately or
  severely harmed immediately or in the near future.
  <ref name="procedures315A">Illinois Department of Children and Family
  Services. (2018). Procedures 315, Appendix A: Child Endangerment Risk
  Assessment (CERAP). Springfield: Author. Retrieved from
  <https://www2.illinois.gov/dcfs/aboutus/notices/Documents/Procedures_315.pdf>

</ref>

## Safety

- The absence of an imminent or immediate threat of moderate-to-serious
  harm to a child. ([Children's Bureau](https://www.childwelfare.gov/))
- Children’s safety is the primary concern of all child welfare
  services, particularly the safety of children who have been identified
  as maltreatment victims. [^20]
- After considering all reasonably available information/evidence
  concerning the presence of each of the 16 safety threats, taking into
  account the vulnerability of the child and considering the
  caregiver(s)’s displayed ability/action to mitigate any identified
  threats, it is then determined that a child in a household or in
  custodial care is not likely to be moderately or severely harmed
  immediately or in the near future. [^21]
- Absence of the child maltreatment re-recurrence is a type of safety
  measurement. There are four outcomes used to measure the safety in
  *B.H.* report: (a) maltreatment recurrence (CFSR indicator); (b)
  maltreatment among children in intact family cases; (c) maltreatment
  recurrence among children receiving no services; and (d) maltreatment
  in substitute care (CFSR indicator).

## Safety plan

- A temporary, short-term plan designed to control serious and immediate
  threats to children’s safety. The safety plan will indicate which
  threat or threats have led to the need for a safety plan as the result
  of the CERAP. Safety Plans must be adequate to ensure the child’s
  safety and be as minimally disruptive to the child and family as is
  reasonably possible. Safety plans can take a variety of forms and are
  developed with the input and voluntary consent of the children’s
  parent(s)/guardian(s), caregivers and other family members. [^22]

## Safety threats

- Safety threats are behaviors or conditions that may be associated with
  a child or children being in danger of moderate to severe harm
  immediately or in the near future.[^23]

## Service

- DCFS has a statutory mandate to make a special effort to stabilize and
  preserve families that are involved in child abuse or neglect
  allegations. The Department uses its own child welfare staff and
  private agencies to provide a variety of services to help the family
  survive and to change patterns of abusive or neglectful behavior.
  These efforts are based on experience that shows that some children
  may do better when kept with their families than when they are placed
  in foster care. The services provided include such things as:
  - service referrals and linkages
  - housing assistance
  - substance abuse assessment and treatment
  - homemaking assistance and training
  - parenting education and support
  - limited financial assistance
  - mental health and family counseling
  - day care of respite care [^24]

## Service type

- Each service type represents a board payment code. To see the
  classification of service types, see DATAREF.servicecd_xref. To view
  the complete list of service types, visit SACWIS.livar_type_service.

## SOR report

- SOR denotes a Subsequent Oral Family Report of suspected
  abuse/neglect, i.e. the family has previously been "indicated" for
  abuse/neglect or there is a previous "pending" report of suspected
  abuse/neglect on file in the SACWIS system.<ref name="IDCFS2017">

Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. (2017). Child
abuse/neglect statistics. Springfield: Author. Retrieved from
<https://www2.illinois.gov/dcfs/aboutus/newsandreports/Documents/CANStat.pdf#search=indicated%20report>

</ref>

## Southern region

- A value of Southern region was defined as regions *4A* (East St.
  Louis) and *5A* (Marion).

## Specialized or treatment foster home

- It involves placement of children with foster families who have been
  specially trained to care for children with certain medical or
  behavioral needs. Examples include medically fragile children,
  children with emotional or behavioral disorders, and children with
  HIV/AIDS. Treatment foster parents are required to obtain addition
  training to become licensed, provide more support for children than
  regular family foster care, and have lower limits on the number of
  children that can be cared for in their home.[^25]
- For the initial placement indicators, a child who enters a
  specialized/treatment foster home and stays in the
  specialized/treatment foster home for 8 days or longer is counted in
  the *B.H.* report.
- For the end-of-year placement indicators, a child placed in a
  specialized/treatment foster home at the end of the fiscal year is
  counted in the *B.H.* report.
- If the type of service arrangement is coded as one of the following
  service payment codes, the placement is defined as specialized or
  treatment foster care.

- Alternatively, if living arrangement type is coded as a) either Foster
  Home Specialized (FHS), Therapeutic Foster Home (TFH), or FHT and b)
  there was no type of service code, then the placement is defined as
  specialized or treatment foster care.

## Spell

- A (Legal) spell is defined as a period for a child in a DCFS legal
  custody during an open child case. A (legal) spell ends with either
  reunification, adoption, guardianship, living with relatives, or
  otherwise exited (see the *censor* column in the *master_spell_legal*
  table). If the case is still open and the child is still under a DCFS
  legal custody, the censor of the spell is "Still in care."
- One of the BH measures, length of stay is calculated for the first
  spell after a child was placed in a substitute care. See [Indicator:
  median length of stay in substitute
  care](BH_Data#ind2g_lengthofstay "wikilink").

## Stability

- Children are entitled to a stable and lasting family life and should
  not be deprived of it except for urgent and compelling reasons.[^26]

## Substantiated

- An investigation disposition concluding that the allegation of child
  maltreatment or risk of maltreatment was supported by State law or
  policy, i.e., that credible evidence exists that child abuse or
  neglect has occurred.([Children's
  Bureau](https://www.childwelfare.gov/))
- See
  [Indicated](https://wiki.cfrc.illinois.edu/index.php/BH_Data#Indicated).

## Subregion

- The state of Illinois is divided into 10 subregions: Rockford (1A);
  Peoria (1B); Aurora (2A); Springfield (3A); Champaign (3B); East St.
  Louis (4A); Marion (5A); Cook North (6B); Cook Central (2B, 6A, 6C,
  6J); and Cook South (6D). See SACWIS.code_desc_ch for more details
  (id_grp=SUBRGNCD).
- To understand the relationships among region code, subregion, and
  region, see the DATAREF.region_xref table.

## Substitute care

- Children should only be removed from their parents and placed in
  substitute care when it is necessary to ensure their safety and
  well-being. Once removed from their homes, the public child welfare
  system and its private agency partners have a responsibility to
  provide children with living arrangements that ensure that they are
  safe from additional harm, maintain connections with their family
  members and community, and provide stability. In addition, substitute
  care should be a temporary solution and children should live in
  substitute care settings for the shortest period necessary.[^27]
- At the simplest level of distinction, substitute care placement types
  can be divided into two categories: foster homes and congregate care.
  The first category includes placements where a child lives with a
  foster parent in their home, and includes kinship foster homes,
  traditional foster homes, and specialized or treatment foster homes
  (i.e., non-congregate care). While it is preferred that children in
  substitute care live in family settings, some children have physical
  or behavioral needs that require placement in congregate care, a
  non-family setting where a group of children receive specialized care
  and treatment (e.g., group home, shelter, residential treatment
  facility). [^28]

### Table 1: Event Excluded from Substitute Care: Indicators 2A - 2G

## Traditional foster home (TFH)

- It involves placement of children with non-relatives in the
  non-relatives' homes. These traditional foster parents have been
  trained, assessed, and licensed to provide shelter and care.[^29]
- For the initial placement indicators, a child who enters a traditional
  foster home and stays in (TFH) for 8 days or longer is counted in the
  *B.H.* report.
- For the end-of-year placement indicators, a child placed in TFH at the
  end of the fiscal year is counted in the *B.H.* report.
- If the type of service arrangement is coded as one of the following
  service payment codes, the placement is defined as TFH.

- Alternatively, if living arrangement type is coded as a) either Foster
  Home Boarding - DCFS (FHB), Foster Home Indian - Licensed Specified or
  Approved by an Indian Child's Tribe (FHI), Foster Home Boarding -
  Private Agency(FHP), Foster Home (FOS) or Foster Home Adoptive (FHA)
  and b) there was no type of service code, then the placement is
  defined as traditional foster home.

## Unfounded

- An investigation of suspected child abuse/neglect has revealed no
  credible evidence that the abuse/neglect occurred.[^30]
- Cases are called "unfounded" when an investigation has determined that
  credible evidence of the alleged abuse or neglect cannot be
  documented. All unfounded reports are kept by the State Central
  Register (SCR) for a period of no less than five years. In addition,
  mandated reporters may request a review of an unfounded report within
  10 days of notification if they have concerns about the adequacy of
  the investigation or if they feel that specific information has been
  overlooked.[^31]
- An investigation report is unfounded if the finding is coded 2 in the
  CD_INVST_FIND field in SACWIS.investigation.
- An allegation is unfounded if the finding is coded 2 in the CD_FIND
  field in SACWIS.invst.allegation.

## Unsafe

- After considering all reasonably available information/evidence
  concerning the presence of each of the 16 potential safety threats,
  taking into account the vulnerability of the child and considering the
  caregiver(s)’s displayed ability/action to mitigate any identified
  threats, it is determined that a child in a household or in custodial
  care is likely to be moderately or severely harmed immediately or in
  the near future. In the event a child is considered Unsafe, a safety
  plan or protective custody must be implemented by the worker
  completing the CERAP and approved by the supervisor. [^32]

## Well-Being

- Children should receive adequate services to meet their educational,
  physical and mental health needs.<ref name="HHS2003">U.S. Department
